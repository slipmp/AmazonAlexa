# Amazon Alexa
Project built for a Hackathon at Cox Automotives on September 2017

Canalex is the project name, it stands for Canada + Alexa
The goal of the solution was only to acquire knowledge on how to use AWS technologies, such as Alexa, Lambda and RDS.

Solution is quite basic, there are some implementations that I would never develop in production environment:
(Queries hard coded, ConnectionString in the code, Console instead of proper Unit tests, etc.). 
But I've decided to upload to my Public GitHub repository just to share this very basic implementation of Alexa using C#
